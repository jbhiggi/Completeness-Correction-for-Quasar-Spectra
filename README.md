# Completeness-Corrected Absorber Statistics from a Quasar Catalogue

This package enables the calculation of the number of absorbers per unit redshift (\(dN/dz\)) and per unit comoving pathlength (\(dN/dX\)), with built-in support for completeness correction on a pixel-by-pixel basis across a catalog of quasar spectra.

It seamlessly incorporates robust uncertainty estimation via bootstrapping, based on the typical pixel scale of absorber detections. These uncertainties are propagated through the completeness calculation and carried forward into the final estimates of \(dN/dz\) and \(dN/dX\).

The completeness calculation employs a novel variation of a commonly used method, designed to more accurately reflect the physical and statistical motivations relevant to large-scale astrophysical surveys.
